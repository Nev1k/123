No room for these doubts
I'll cast them far away
And take up my father's sword
History favors the daring
Only the brave will receive the eternal reward, ah
Will you be here ready to guide me?
When I must leave this dream behind me
A beacon of hope, but fading away
I have to let that light die, let it die
