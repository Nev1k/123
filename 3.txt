Long been complacent with the hand I've been dealt
Restless and weak from the life that I've built
So I'll journey afar, for there's glory to find
And I'll fill out my entry in the annals of time
Bid my farewell to the ones I love
Their grief but a fleeting feeling
For nature is calling, my heart compelled
Every branch, every leaf has a story to tell.
